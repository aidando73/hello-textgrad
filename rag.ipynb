       "- **Definition**: Low memory is the portion of physical memory that is directly accessible by the kernel without any special handling. On 32-bit systems, this typically includes the first 896 MB of RAM.\n",
       "- **Address Space**: It is mapped directly into the kernel's address space, allowing the kernel to access it easily and efficiently.\n",
       "- **Usage**: Low memory is used for kernel data structures, buffers, and other critical components that require fast and direct access by the kernel.\n",
       "- **Limitations**: The size of low memory is limited by the architecture and the kernel's address space layout, which can be a constraint on systems with large amounts of RAM.\n",

       "- **Address Space**: High memory requires special handling to be accessed by the kernel. It is not directly accessible and must be mapped into the kernel's address space temporarily when needed.\n",
       "- **Usage**: High memory is used for user-space applications and data that do not require constant access by the kernel. It is managed using techniques like paging to make it accessible when necessary.\n",
       "- **Handling**: The kernel uses mechanisms like page tables to map high memory into its address space as needed, which can introduce some overhead compared to low memory access.\n",
